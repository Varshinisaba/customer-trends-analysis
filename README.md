## ⚙️ Workflow  
### 1️⃣ Data Extraction and Cleaning  
- Imported customer and sales data from CSV files using **SQL** and **Python**  
- Cleaned missing values and standardized data formats  
- Created structured tables for customers, transactions, and products  
### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Used **Python** libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to analyze trends  
- Derived key insights like total revenue by category, repeat customer rates, and purchase frequency  
- Identified high-value customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics  
### 3️⃣ SQL Queries and Analysis  
- Wrote SQL queries to join and filter data for deeper insights  
- Created views for:  
  - Top 10 customers by total purchase value  
  - Monthly revenue trends  
  - Product category performance  
### 4️⃣ Visualization and Reporting  
- Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** showing:  
  - Total sales and revenue by region  
  - Customer segmentation and top spenders  
  - Monthly/quarterly sales trends  
## 📈 Key Insights  
- **Electronics** and **Apparel** were top-performing categories.  
- Over **60% of customers** were repeat buyers.  
- **Seasonal peaks** observed during festive periods.  
- Data-driven segmentation improved customer targeting strategies.
